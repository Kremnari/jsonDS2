# jsonDS2
A tool for creating JSON Data-Schema/Data-Source files


# Why
I've seen many tools that can generate a schema based on a JSON,
or create a JSON database based on a schema,
But never a tool to create both simultaneously.
As I tend to iteratively develop both the program 
and it's data source, a tool like this will allow me to keep 
The data source in line with program expectations
